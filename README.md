# UBS.Risk.Evaluator.Batch 🏦⚙️

Welcome to **UBS.Risk.Evaluator.Batch**! This project is responsible for processing and classifying trades automatically, logging, and generating classified outputs. The solution is organized into two projects:

1. **UBS.Risk.Evaluator.Batch** (main project)  
2. **UBS.Risk.Evaluator.Batch.Test** (unit testing project)

### Key Directories:

- **Application**  
  Contains the trade processing logic, such as the `TradeProcessor` class.

- **Domain**  
  Responsible for the project's business rules.

- **Infrastructure**  
  Responsible for support services, such as file reading and writing (`FileManager`).

- **Local**
  Example directory where input or output files are located.

- **appsettings.json**  
  Configuration file defining input and output paths, among other variables.

- **Dockerfile**  
  Allows the creation of a Docker image to run the project in a container.

- **UBS.Risk.Evaluator.Batch.Test**  
  Contains unit tests written in **xUnit**. Here you find `TradeProcessorTests.cs` and other test files.

    ```
    This will run all tests in UBS.Risk.Evaluator.Batch.Test and display the result in the console.

## How to Build the Docker Image 🐳

1. **Open project directory**
    ```bash
    cd UBS.Risk.Evaluator.Batch    
    ```

2. **Create the Image**
